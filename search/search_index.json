They are maintained by itemis, JetBrains and the open source community and its development is closely related to the development of MPS.\n\n\nMPS Extensions and mbeddr (platform)\n\n\nHow is the relationship between the mbeddr (platform) and this project?\n\n\nThe mbeddr project in the past developed a set of extensions that where used to  allow easier development of languages with MPS. These extensions where not C specific and were called \nmbeddr platform\n. This project aims to give these extensions a new home. To make them more visible but also emphasise that these extensions are independent of mbeddr and it's C implementation in MPS. The midterm goal is to migrate most of these extensions in this project. Not all of them will really fit here because some of these are very experimental or have very specific use cases. Our goal is to migrate the stable bits first. See the \nmigration\n section of the documentation on what we plan to migrate at the moment and how you could help.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nTo get started grab a release from our release page on \ngithub\n. Extract the archive and point a project or global library in MPS to the location where you extracted it. \n\n\nSee the documentation regarding the individual extensions above. The documentation is \"currently work in progress\" as it being ported over from the mbeddr platform repository. Documentation related contributions are very welcome!\n\n\nWe are also working on providing a zip file with all the sandboxes we have in our repository in order to try things out and see how the extensions work. See this issue for \ndetails\n. \n\n\nArtefacts in the Nexus\n\n\nWe also provide the artefacts as a maven repository. Where you can fetch them during your CI build to setup your local development environment. \n\n\nMaven:\n\n\nproject ...\n\n    \nrepositories\n\n        \nrepository\n\n          \nid\nitemis.mbeddr\n/id\n\n          \nurl\nhttps://projects.itemis.de/nexus/content/repositories/mbeddr\n/url\n\n        \n/repository\n\n     \n/repositories\n\n\n     \ndependencies ...\n\n         \ndependency\n\n          \ngroupId\nde.itemis.mps\n/groupId\n\n          \nartifactId\nextensions\n/artifactId\n\n          \nversion\n2018.1\n/version\n\n          \ntype\nzip\n/type\n\n        \n/dependency\n\n    \n/dependencies\n\n\n/project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGradle:\n\n\n    repositories {\n        maven { url 'https://projects.itemis.de/nexus/content/repositories/mbeddr' }\n    }\n\n    configurations {\n        mpsExtensions\n    }\n\n    dependencies {\n        mpsExtensions \nde.itemis.mps:extensions:2018.1.+\n\n    }\n\n\n\n\nVersions\n\n\nThe version number reflects the MPS version the extensions are compatible with. For instance \n2018.1.X\n is compatible with MPS 2018.1, \n2017.3.X\n is compatible with MPS 2017.3.6. We only maintain compatibility with the latest minor release for each major version. While a \n2017.3.x\n version of the extension might work with a on older version than MPS 2017.3.6 we only test it against the latest.    \n\n\nCurrent Versions\n\n\nCurrently these MPS versions are supported. Versions prior to MPS 2017.3 might still be available as the mbeddr platform but are not maintained in the repository.\n\n\nA version in maintenance will not get actively new features and is only maintained with bugfixes.

It is \nnot\n a replacement for version control systems like \ngit\n.\n\n\nAn example use case might be a model is used to describe an API and the users wants to detect changes between different releases of the API. This API has a version number that follows semVer associated with it. Now when users wants check what changes happened since the last release the information stored by this extension can be used to diff the current state against the last released one.\n\n\nThe scope of this extension is to provide a way to store the versions of a node and do change detection. It does intentionally not provide ways how to semantically reason about a change as this is highly domain specific. It might be used in conjunction with the \nnodecomparator\n to do structural diffs between versions.\n\n\nState: \nIncubating\n \n\n\nThis extension is currently incubating and might under go substantial changes in the future. Currently it only supports storing of the version information and change detection. For future feature ideas see the \npotential features\n section.\n\n\nWhat is a \nNode\n\n\nWhen we speak of a node in this document we mean the node and \nall\n of its children but not of the referenced nodes. Sometimes this is also called \nsubtree\n.\n\n\nWhen we speak of the \ndependencies\n of a node we mean all nodes that are referenced by either node itself or it children. \n\n\nMeta Model\n\n\n\n\nThe version information is stored on the node that is versioned as a \nNodeAttribute\n called \nNodeVersion\n. The \nNodeVersion\n contains a copy of the node at point in time when the version was created. In addition to the copy it also stores a \nVersionNumber\n which is a simple integer incremented with each version that is created. The \nVersionNumber\n has no other semantics than to provide ordering to the versions. To be able to detect changes of a node it also stores a hash of the node. The \nNodeVersion\n also contains a list of all the dependencies (reference targets) of the node and its version, these are called \nLinkVersion\n. \n\n\nChange Detection\n\n\nOn first glance change detection looks pretty straight forward. A node has changed when either the node itself has changed or one of the dependencies:\n\n\n\n\nBut if we at MPS models they are not simple tree but graphs that allow reference cycles. In this cases we cannot simply traverse the complete graph over the edges since we would end up in a cycle. Imagine model like this:\n\n\n\n\nIn this case the change detection has to take into account that there is a cycle from \n5 --\n 4 --\n 6 --\n 5\n. The change detection algorithm detects this cycle and handles them appropriately. If none of the participants in a cycle have local changes then the whole cycle is assumed to be unchanged.\n\n\nTechnically the detection if a node has changed since the last time it has been versioned is done via hashing. If the hash differs from the hash calculated for the last version then the node has changed. The current implementation uses SHA 1 hashes to verify if the node has changed. \n\n\nPotential Features\n\n\n\n\ntime travel\n: Getting the model back into the exact same state as it was when a specific version on a node was created. Most likely as some kind of \ntransient\n model that is not visible to the user. \n\n\nReferencing nodes in a specific version. While this to some degree already happens behind the scenes. It might be useful for the user to implement an API in specific version.\n\n\nDelete handling. At the moment when the user deletes a node that is still referenced from some other node in an older version (that is potentially not visible to the user) the model is in a broken state.\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nThe general pattern that all functionally of the \nnodeversioning\n extension that all parts follow is that it will \nnever\n mutate the model during its execution. It will collect changes or calculate a new set of \nNodeVersions\n but its up to the user of the extension to actually mutate the model. This behaviour is due to the fact that the domain requires human interaction to review the changes and allow to veto based on that review. \n\n\nFirst of all models that should get versioned need to use the \nde.itemis.mps.nodeversioning\n language.
